# Wescap Power Index  
  
  
### What is it?
The Wescap Power Index (WCPI) is a power ranking algorithm that puts a number on skill. This is useful for Fortnite friend groups of numbers more than 4, as it provides an objective way of determining which players get to stay in the party and which get banished to the B team.
  
This is a learning project, as I am neither a web nor python developer, so if something seem like it's hacked together, it's because it is. The project currently isn't in a state where it can be cloned and run easily, but hopefully it will in the future.   
  
Recently I've been making an effort to remove all the hacks and turn this code into something beautiful. Creating this repo was the first step. The next steps include integrating Jenkins, adding a config file for database access, and tests.
